## _Current Project Information On_**LUMIX**

Currently I am working on headphones that react to the sound that you are listening to. These headphones help you express your style in a way that lights up the area.

### _How I Made The Product_
After I had bought the pair of headphones I used a gemma from arduino. I programmed the gemma to run a simple light pattern of two lights seeming to chase each other. This wasn't the finished product, but it gave me an idea on how the headphones will look when finished. Now the hard part will come up. I had to research and code on how to make convert analog to digital data. When I had figured that out, I created the codea nd tested it out on an Arduino Uno and a strip of led lights. Now I have to place that same code onto to the arduino gemma and led circle with an attached mic. When I am finished with this, I'll be one step closer to finishing. The mic allows the lights to react on sound outside, so now I have to be able to allow the lights to react with the sound/music one is listening to. Finally, I would be finished.
